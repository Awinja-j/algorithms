# Algorithms

Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output.

From the data structure point of view, following are some important categories of algorithms:

- Search: Algorithm to search an item in a data structure.

- Sort: Algorithm to sort items in a certain order.

- Insert: Algorithm to insert item in a data structure.

- Update: Algorithm to update an existing item in a data structure.

- Delete: Algorithm to delete an existing item from a data structure.

### Characteristics of an Algorithm

Not all procedures can be called an algorithm. An algorithm should have the following characteristics:

- Unambiguous: Algorithm should be clear and unambiguous. Each of its steps (or phases), and their inputs/outputs should be clear and must lead to only one meaning.

- Input: An algorithm should have 0 or more well-defined inputs.

- Output: An algorithm should have 1 or more well-defined outputs, and should match the desired output.

- Finiteness: Algorithms must terminate after a finite number of steps.

- Feasibility: Should be feasible with the available resources.

- Independent: An algorithm should have step-by-step directions, which should be independent of any programming code.

## how to write an algorithm

We write algorithms in a step-by-step manner, but it is not always the case. Algorithm writing is a process and is executed after the problem domain is well-defined. That is, we should know the problem domain, for which we are designing a solution.
